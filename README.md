# What is this?
This is a system or module or whatever the specific term is designed for Foundry to run the Liber Imperium TTRPG.
It was made by someone (me) off of the Dark Heresy 2e system or module or whatever the specific term is for Foundry, which is itself very awesome and cool.
I am something less than a novice, and it is very rough, but ultimately functional, and I use it my own campaign which I game master for. We have played with it for the last two sessions, and I think I've gotten most of the errors.

# Known issues:
For some reason, at least, for my character sheets, some of my players randomly have the Security skill as a Common Skill despite it being a Trade Skill in Liber Imperium. Only some do, not all, so you may be fine.
There may or may not be some stranded, left over code from when I tried to port the voidship functionality of the Rogue Trader fork of the Dark Heresy 2e module left in the code. I think I got rid of all of it since it didn't work, but there might still be some present.

# That's about it
I usually fix issues as I uncover them in play, I just can't find a way to fix the Security problem. If you use this system (thank youf for that) please tell me any issues, and I'll try to resolve them. Again, this is literally my first project related to coding in any regard.

# This is also my first time using Github, too.
